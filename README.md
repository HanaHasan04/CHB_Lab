> Effective emotional expression is a fundamental component of human communication, and it exhibits intriguing variations among individuals with different hearing abilities. Exploring the differences in emotional expression across individuals with diverse hearing abilities can offer valuable insights into the intricate dynamics between communication and hearing.
In this study, we aim to compare emotional expression across three distinct groups: **hearing** individuals, **deaf** individuals, and **CODA** (Children of Deaf Adults) individuals. Hearing individuals rely primarily on speech, while deaf individuals primarily use sign language for communication. CODA individuals, on the other hand, have been exposed to both speech and signing from early childhood due to their deaf parents, resulting in unique language and communication experiences.
